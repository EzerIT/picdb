Resource Website - Programmer's Guide
=====================================

Claus TÃ¸ndering - 20 September 2023

Setup:

Configuration is located in the file config.inc.php. A skeleton of this file is provided in
config.inc.php-dist.

Everthing below the folders "photos" and "unpub" must belong to user www-data:www-data.


Programming:

The Resource Website code is written in PHP. It's fairly old-fashioned as it was written for PHP
version 5. It uses no PHP framework; for JavaScript is uses JQuery and JQuery-UI.

The PHP files include "wrapper.inc.php", which defines this function

    function wrapme($title, $headerscript, $leftbox, $bodytext, $include_js=array(), $include_css=array(), $show_menu=true)


This function generates the HTML code for a web page, its arguments are:

    $title - The title of the web page.
    $headerscript - JavaScript to be added to the output.
    $leftbox - HTML for the box on the left.
    $bodytext - HTML for the main body.
    $include_js - Array of JavaScript files to be included.
    $include_css - Array of CSS files to be included.
    $show_menu - Can the administration menu be shown on this page?

The code makes heavy use of the functions ob_start() and ob_get_clean(). Any HTML generated between
the calls to these two functions is not output, but is returned as the value of the ob_get_clean()
function.
